# Customer-Segmentation-with-RFM-Score
A Data Science Project Using RFM Analysis

## Business Problem
An e-commerce company wants to segment its customers and determine marketing strategies according to these segments.

For this, we will define the behavior of customers and create groups according to the clusters in these behaviors.

In other words, we will take those who exhibit common behaviors into the same groups and we will try to develop sales and marketing specific techniques to these groups.
